Market Research on Carnival Corporation

Summary of Research

1. Introduction
Background: Carnival Corporation, founded in 1972, is the largest leisure travel company, significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Safety concerns have eroded customer confidence, particularly among older travelers.
Current Issues: The pandemic has changed perceptions of cruise travel, necessitating a marketing strategy to rebuild trust and attract both previous cruisers and new customers.

2. Research Aims
Understand customer concerns about cruising safety.
Develop marketing strategies to address these concerns.
Explore changes in cruise travel perceptions across demographic groups.
Identify ways to attract non-cruisers to the cruise experience.

3. Research Methodology
Design: The research is exploratory and descriptive, using a deductive approach with quantitative data gathered through surveys.
Data Analysis: Various statistical techniques (e.g., T-tests, ANOVA, regression analysis) will be employed to analyze customer concerns, marketing preferences, and perceptions across demographic segments.

4. Data Collection
Target audience includes past cruisers and non-cruisers, with an estimated sample size of approximately 4,136 respondents (2,000 cruisers and 2,136 non-cruisers).
Data will include demographics, marketing preferences, and perceptions of cruise safety.

5. Results Analysis
Concerns about Safety: A one-sample T-test will determine the level of concern (with a neutrality score of 5). If average scores exceed 5, it indicates significant concern.
Decision Influence: A Chi-square test will examine the association between safety concerns and the decision to cruise.
Marketing Strategy Preference: A one-way ANOVA will identify the preferred marketing strategies among customers.
Demographic Perception Changes: Multiple linear regression will assess how perceptions differ across demographics.
Attracting Non-Cruisers: A two-group discriminant analysis will evaluate the effectiveness of predictor variables in appealing to non-cruisers.

6. Future Research & Implications

Expected Outcomes
The results will guide Carnival Corporation in addressing customer safety concerns, enhancing marketing efforts, and expanding its customer base by attracting non-cruisers. Insights gained will be critical in reshaping the company's approach to regain customer trust in cruise travel post-pandemic.

KEY FINDINGS

Customer Safety Concerns:
Customers are expected to express significant concern about the safety of cruising due to COVID-19, likely scoring above the neutral point of 5 on a 0-10 scale.
Safety concerns are anticipated to strongly influence customers' decisions to travel on cruises.

Influence of Demographics:
Changes in perception of cruising before and after COVID-19 may vary across different demographic groups (age, gender, income, etc.), indicating that certain groups may have heightened fears or altered views about cruise safety.
